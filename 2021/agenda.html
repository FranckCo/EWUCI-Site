        <h1>European Workshop on Urban Climate Indicators, 2021 Edition, 17 May 2021, on line</h1>
		<h1>Agenda</h1>

		<p>See <a href="../index.html">here</a> for general context about the EWUCI Workshop.</p>

		<h2>9:00 - 10:15 : Session 1</h2>

		<h3>Welcome adress</h3>

		<h3>What data to manage summer comfort in urban planing projects in France?</h3>

		<p>Julia Hidalgo, CNRS/LISST (Interdisciplinary Laboratory on Society Solidarity and Territory)</p>

		<h3>Designing solutions for municipalities specific needs related to adapting to UHI</h3>

		<p>Christophe Bortolaso, Berger-Levrault</p>

		<h2>10:15 -10h45 : Break</h2>

		<h2>10:45 - 12:15 : Session 2</h2>

		<h3>Co-construction of Climate Services based on a meteorological stations monitoring network in Toulouse agglomeration</h3>

		<p>Guillaume Dumas, CNRM, Toulouse Métropole</p>

		<h3>Using Satellite Data for Urban Environmental Measures</h3>

		<p>Maren Koehlmann, Institute for Research and Development in Federal Statistics</p>

		<h3>New air quality measurement service for cities</h3>

		<p>Tarek Habib, Murmuration, <a href="https://murmuration-sas.com/en/homepage">https://murmuration-sas.com/en/homepage</a></p>

		<p>Continuous monitoring of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) is of vital importance as it is key to measure our progress towards the achievement of the sustainability of our environment. The same applies to global atmospheric simulation of GHGs variations and fluxes that enables us to understand and build the future climatic scenarios. Both tasks are complex requiring high computational costs, human validation work and a large number of geographically distributed measurement instruments. The space agencies ESA and NASA have developed in the last decade satellites capable of measuring air quality, through the observation of GHGs, with increased accuracy. Satellites are capable of measuring the concentration of GHGs in the troposphere.</p>

		<p>We propose to present our findings in computing the correlation between ground-based data using the ICOS infrastructure data with OCO2 and S5P satellite data to validate the use of satellites to improve our global observation capacity and the global simulation models of GHGs. On the other hand, we will present the possibility of creating a monitoring service for cities, scalable on a global scale and its economic model</p>

		<h2>12:15 - 14:00 Lunch break</h2>

		<h2>14:00 - 16:30 : Session 3</h2>

		<h3>Urban climate and adaptation: from local to European scales, back and forth</h3>

		<p>Alban Mallet, Ecological transition department, Greater Nantes Metropolitan Area</p>

		<p>This presentation tackles encountered challenges from the perspective of an operational practioner to adapt a city to climate change. At the local scale, the transfer of knowledge from scientific requires more interoperability and common referentials. At a higher scale, territories gather to compile and consolidate observations and knowledge in so-called regional IPCC. At a european scale, collaboration betwen cities, in Eurocities, also is important to participate to the european regulation process.</p>

		<h3>Contribution on assessing methodological approaches for SDG indicator analysis</h3>

		<p>Gwendolin Seidner-Schötz, Patrick Knoefel, and Jeanette Kretz, BKG (German federal agency for cartography and geodesy)</p>

		<h3>Overview on selected challenges through the lens of ERA4CS URCLIM project and other projects</h3>

		<p>Athanasios Votsis, Adriaan Perrels, Valéry Masson, University of Twente, Finnish Meteorological Institute, Météo France</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Designing urban adaptation indicators (C3)</li>
			<li>Revising urban concepts and definitions used in Europe for urban climate studies (C2)</li>
			<li>Adding environmental indicators to the European Grid LAEA (C1)</li>
		</ul>
