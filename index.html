        <h1>European Workshop on Urban Climate Indicators</h1>

		<p>The European Workshop on Urban Climate Indicators tackles the design of relevant and computable urban climate indicators to study and adapt to climate change, specifically indicators that can be scaled in space and in time throughout Europe thanks to a better access to and better sharing of data.</p>

		<p>Targeted audience is scientists and experts who specify, prototype or produce indicators relevant to urban climate study, scientists and experts who advance the field of information infrastructure to support this application.</p>

		<h2>Context and objectives</h2>

		<p>Modelling urban climate phenomena and their impacts requires data about the topography, buildings characteristics, vegetation, and also data about the socio-economic context. It also requires expertise in the different computation domains, statistics, remote sensing, spatial analysis, machine learning and in the urban and climate domains to design relevant indicators.</p>

		<p>Scalability in space and time refers to the capacity to use these indicators beyond an initial spatio-temporal scope, for example to compare values with another time period or with another city. It also refers to the change of level of detail for instance to contribute to european regulations based on facts and learnings that make sense at more local scales.</p>

		<p>In terms of data, the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment provides more resolute simulations and the Public Sector Information Reuse directive will lead to more high resolution geographical, meteorological and statistical data to be open in Europe. These are opportunities for urban climate indicators design. Yet, designing scalable urban climate indicators is hindered by multiple heterogeneities to consider, either heterogeneities between territories that have different topographies or different cultures, or heterogeneities in the technologies (remote sensing data, structured databases with different classifications) and also variations in rules affecting access, transparency and charging. This is altogether a typical application of heterogeneous information brokering on spatial data infrastructures.</p>
